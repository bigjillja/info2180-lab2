        <h2>Why dogs are better than cats.</h2>
        <h4>September 29, 2022 by Martin</h4>

        <p>Hot dogs or hamburgers? *NSYNC or Backstreet Boys? These are some of the greatest debates in history.
            However, perhaps no debate causes people to fight like cats and dogs more than the debate over, well, cats and dogs. 
            Which pet makes a better best friend? Of course, like the debates over BBQ fare and boy bands, this fight is all in good fun. 
            Both types of pets make great friends, and the best one for you often depends on your personality and lifestyle.

            Many people believe that dogs are superior to cats. Dogs are easier to train, go potty outside, can guard you, and encourage an active lifestyle. 
            Having a dog is preferable to having a cat because of all the advantages. 
            And it is conceivable to love both while believing that one is superior to the other. For one, dogs don't need litter boxes. It's probably fair to say that even cat lovers don't love litter boxes. 
            No matter how well you keep up with them, there always seems to be a lingering odor. Plus, litter often tracks all over the house. 
            It's practically impossible to find a good place to put the litter box in a small house. 
            Scooping the stuff is stinky and dusty. Dogs don't need litter boxes. They can be house-trained and most can stick to a schedule. 
            They can use the yard or do their business during walks around the neighborhood. You only have to pick up the poop, not the urine the way you have to do with litter boxes. 
            And as for the poop, you can simply use poop bags on walks and a poop-scooper in the yard. Cleaning up poop may not be fun, but many think it's the lesser of two necessary evils.

        <h2>Why you should study Computer Science</h2>

            Many computer science and IT professionals started out as kids who fell in love with all the new and exciting things they could do on computers. 
            “I remember going to my cousins’ homes after school and spending hours trying new things on their computers,” says Richard Lubicky, founder of RealPeopleSearch. 
            “While others would like to play video games or watch movies, I was interested in learning the working of this machine and installing different programs.”
            This initial curiosity and excitement over exploring this technology lends itself perfectly to a burgeoning career. 
            A degree in Computer Science can open even more opportunities to explore your curiosity to its fullest—in fact, these types of problem-solving skills are highly valued in the tech world!

            There’s a certain sense of accomplishment that comes with being able to create something from (practically) nothing. 
            That’s true for a craftsman framing a house and for a software engineer tasked with designing and building a new program feature.
            Understanding various programming languages, databases, hardware systems and what makes them work means computer science professionals 
            have the skills to build apps, tools and software programs from the ground up. While you’re not likely to be taking on an entire software 
            development project by yourself, you’ll still have the satisfaction that comes with being a creator.“It is empowering. If you’ve got an idea, 
            you can go out there and build it,” Pour says. “It’s fascinating what type of complex systems can be made.”
