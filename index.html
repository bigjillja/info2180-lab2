        <h2>Why dogs are better than cats.</h2>
        <h4>September 29, 2022 by Martin</h4>
        <p>Hot dogs or hamburgers? *NSYNC or Backstreet Boys? These are some of the greatest debates in history.
            However, perhaps no debate causes people to fight like cats and dogs more than the debate over, well, cats and dogs. 
            Which pet makes a better best friend? Of course, like the debates over BBQ fare and boy bands, this fight is all in good fun. 
            Both types of pets make great friends, and the best one for you often depends on your personality and lifestyle.

            Many people believe that dogs are superior to cats. Dogs are easier to train, go potty outside, can guard you, and encourage an active lifestyle. 
            Having a dog is preferable to having a cat because of all the advantages. 
            And it is conceivable to love both while believing that one is superior to the other.
